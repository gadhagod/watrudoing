# watrudoing
A shell that makes fun of you when you mess up on the command line.

Techinally put, when a command is not found, it plays [audio.mp3](audio.mp3). 
Why? Because I'm bored and I want to make fun of people.

## Installation
Just copy [install.sh](install.sh) into your machine and run it. This will clone the repo in your home directory and use NPM to install the utility. DO NOT REMOVE THE REPO FROM YOUR HOME DIRECTORY!.

## Usage
Enter the shell by running `watrudoing`. To test everything, type `baskljfdlakjsdfl` in your shell.
